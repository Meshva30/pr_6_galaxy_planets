    "description": "The Sun is a massive, glowing sphere of hot gases, primarily hydrogen and helium, located at the center of our solar system. It is about 1.39 million kilometers in diameter and produces energy through nuclear fusion in its core, where hydrogen atoms fuse into helium. This process releases immense amounts of energy, which we experience as sunlight and heat. The Sun's surface temperature is around 5,500 degrees Celsius, and its activity, including sunspots and solar flares, affects space weather and Earth's environment. The Sun is currently in its main sequence stage and has been shining for approximately 4.6 billion years, with an estimated 5 billion years left before it evolves into a red giant and eventually a white dwarf.",

    "description": "Mercury is the smallest and closest planet to the Sun in our solar system, with a diameter of about 4,880 kilometers. It has a rocky composition and an iron-rich core. Due to its proximity to the Sun, Mercury experiences extreme temperatures, ranging from about 430°C (800°F) during the day to -180°C (-290°F) at night. It has a thin atmosphere, primarily composed of oxygen, sodium, and hydrogen, which cannot retain heat. Mercury's surface is covered with craters from numerous impacts, similar to our Moon. It has a very short orbital period, taking just 88 Earth days to complete a trip around the Sun.",

    "description": "Venus, the second planet from the Sun, is similar in size and structure to Earth, with a diameter of about 12,104 kilometers. Often called Earth's \"sister planet,\" Venus has a thick atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid, creating a runaway greenhouse effect. This results in extremely high surface temperatures, averaging around 465°C (869°F), making Venus the hottest planet in our solar system. The surface features vast plains, volcanic mountains, and craters. Venus rotates very slowly and in the opposite direction of most planets, with one day on Venus lasting 243 Earth days. Its dense atmosphere and harsh conditions make it a challenging target for exploration.",

It has a diameter of about 12,742 kilometers and a diverse surface composed of continents and oceans. Earth’s atmosphere, rich in nitrogen and oxygen, provides the air we breathe and protects us from harmful solar radiation. The planet's climate and weather are driven by the Sun's energy, supporting a variety of ecosystems. Earth has a dynamic geology, with plate tectonics shaping its surface over millions of years. Its rotation period is 24 hours, creating a day-night cycle, and it orbits the Sun in 365.25 days, defining our year and seasons.",

It has a diameter of about 6,779 kilometers and features the largest volcano and the deepest canyon in the solar system. Mars has a thin atmosphere composed mostly of carbon dioxide, with surface temperatures ranging from -125°C (-195°F) to 20°C (68°F). The planet experiences seasons, polar ice caps, and dust storms. Evidence suggests Mars once had liquid water, raising questions about its potential to support life. Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, and continues to be a major focus of exploration for its potential for future human habitation.",

It is a gas giant composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, lacking a solid surface. Jupiter is known for its prominent bands of clouds and the Great Red Spot, a massive storm larger than Earth that has raged for centuries. The planet has a strong magnetic field and at least 79 moons, including the four large Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Jupiter's immense size and gravitational influence play a crucial role in the dynamics of the solar system.",
